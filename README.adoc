== Installation and Setup

=== Starting the Server
Run the following command from the project root:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up --build
----

NOTE: You may need to use `sudo` depending on your Docker configuration.

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints at `localhost:8090` using Postman or curl.

=== Email Configuration
The system uses a hardcoded SMTP host configuration. For testing purposes, please use a Yopmail email address.

Start the documentation server (example using port 9090):

[source,bash]
----
npx http-server -p 9090 -c-1 .
